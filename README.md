# Balance-Blue-Dark GNOME/GTK3 Theme

Balance-Blue-Dark theme is a custom version of ZorinBlue-Dark theme based on my own preferences.

Features:

- Icons are borrowed from ZorinBlue-Dark
- GTK 3.0 CSS styling is borrowed from ZorinGrey-Dark theme but I made colors a bit brighter than the original theme.
- The GNOME shell theme is borrowed from ZorinGrey-Dark theme but I made colors a bit brighter than the original theme.
- The beautiful blue gradient color used in ZorinBlue-Light is used.
