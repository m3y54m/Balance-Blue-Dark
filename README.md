# Balance-Blue-Dark GNOME/GTK3 Theme

Balance-Blue-Dark theme is a custom version of ZorinBlue-Dark theme based on my own preferences.

Features:

- Icons are borrowed from ZorinBlue-Dark
- GTK 3.0 CSS styling is borrowed from ZorinGrey-Dark theme but I made colors a bit brighter than the original theme.
- The GNOME shell theme is borrowed from ZorinGrey-Dark theme but I made colors a bit brighter than the original theme.
- The beautiful blue gradient color used in ZorinBlue-Light is used.

## Installation

Clone this git repository:

```console
git clone https://github.com/m3y54m/Balance-Blue-Dark.git
cd Balance-Blue-Dark
```

Copy Balance-Blue-Dark to `.themes` directory:

```console
mkdir -p ~/.themes
cp -r Balance-Blue-Dark ~/.themes
```

Now you can activate `Balance-Blue-Dark` theme using `Zorin Appearance` or `GNOME Tweaks`.
