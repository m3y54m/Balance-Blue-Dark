# Balance-Blue-Dark GNOME/GTK3 Theme

Balance-Blue-Dark theme is a combination of the best features of the official [Zorin OS](https://zorin.com/os/) themes, along with some minor modifications. 

The source code for the original Zorin OS themes can be found at this links:

https://github.com/ZorinOS/zorin-desktop-themes

https://github.com/ZorinOS/zorin-icon-themes

Features of Balance-Blue-Dark:

- Icons are borrowed from `ZorinBlue-Light` and `ZorinGrey-Dark`
- GTK 3.0 CSS styling is borrowed from `ZorinGrey-Dark` theme but I made colors a bit bluish and brighter than the original theme.
- The GNOME shell theme is borrowed from `ZorinGrey-Dark` theme but I made colors a bit bluish and brighter than the original theme.
- The beautiful blue gradient color used in `ZorinBlue-Light` is added to this theme.
- Fix some bugs of Zorin original dark themes.
