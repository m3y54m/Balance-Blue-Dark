# Balance-Blue-Dark GNOME/GTK3 Theme

Balance-Blue-Dark theme is a mixture of all good features of [Zorin OS](https://zorin.com/os/) official themes with some minor enhancements.

Original Zorin OS themes source code is found here:

https://github.com/ZorinOS/zorin-desktop-themes

Features of Balance-Blue-Dark:

- Icons are borrowed from ZorinBlue-Light
- GTK 3.0 CSS styling is borrowed from ZorinGrey-Dark theme but I made colors a bit brighter than the original theme.
- The GNOME shell theme is borrowed from ZorinGrey-Dark theme but I made colors a bit brighter than the original theme.
- The beautiful blue gradient color used in ZorinBlue-Light is added to this dark theme.
- Fix some bugs of Zorin original dark themes.
