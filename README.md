# ZorinBlue-Dark Customized

Customized version of ZorinBlue-Dark theme according to my own preferences.

Features:

- Icons are borrowed from ZorinBlue-Dark
- GTK 3.0 CSS styling is borrowed from ZorinGrey-Dark theme but I made colors a bit brighter than the original theme.
- The GNOME shell theme is borrowed from ZorinGrey-Dark theme but I made colors a bit brighter than the original theme.
- The beautiful blue gradient color used in ZorinBlue-Light is used.
